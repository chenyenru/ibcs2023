Yesterday, we had the meeting to discuss about our CAS proposal. The discussion went very smoothly, although another coleader was absent without notice, at least the leader and I finished our parts.

I've subtly reminded the leader to be more responsible on this event euphematically by asking he's availability. He responded with that he'd been very busy with learning machine learning/ doing side projects in the past weeks.

I am grateful that the conversation was peaceful, rational, and efficient. Which maybe it would be better to just tell my feelings immediately next time if anything similar happens.

Last Sunday I had a biking trip with my mom to Mingdao. It serves mainly as a practice for me (~13km) to get on the road. Actual biking (dynamic?) feels very different. The views I see from the farmlands and the places that I never knew were in Taichung really did fascinate me. 

Well after years away from bikes, I was quite afraid that I would not make to Mingdao (final destination). Yet something assuring is that I have been doing stationary bike exercises, so stamina wouldn't be a problem. The main problem is about being aware of my surrounding (fast cars ðŸš˜), especially when changing lanes or even just with some small moves horizontally, I would need to look back (but couldn't actually see the back). In retrospect, that was quite dangerous especially that the cars were driving very fast, which the only thing I did was to gradually move left or right (totally trusting the car ðŸ˜¨).

Thus, I've consulted [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TFCLJaqM1s). According to the video. Next time, I would:
1. use my arms to mark where I'm going (left, right, or stop)
2. turn back and see what's going on (requires biking skills, especially balance!)
