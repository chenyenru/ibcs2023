Yesterday, we had the meeting to discuss about our CAS proposal. The discussion went very smoothly, although another coleader was absent without notice, at least the leader and I finished our parts.

I've subtly reminded the leader to be more responsible on this event euphematically by asking he's availability. He responded with that he'd been very busy with learning machine learning/ doing side projects in the past weeks.

I am grateful that the conversation was peaceful, rational, and efficient. Which maybe it would be better to just tell my feelings immediately next time if anything similar happens.
